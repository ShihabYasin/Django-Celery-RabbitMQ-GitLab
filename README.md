# Dockerizing (Docker, Docker-Compose) a Django app that uses PostgreSQL, Celery, RabbitMQ and nginx with GitLab CI / CD

Basic Django app to Dockerize and Gitlab CI/CD for deployment. 

## Step 1: Create a GitLab repository

Create a [blank GitLab project](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/create-project.html), 
push your project from local machine to GitLab. After that you will probably get something like that
![Project structure](https://pp.userapi.com/c850224/v850224063/1058e3/tEToCCj-dBk.jpg)

For the guide I will use following project URL:

`https://gitlab.com/your_username/your_project_name/`

You have to replace `your_username` and `your_project_name` in the source code to make it work. 

## Step 2: Create a Dockerfile

**Source file:** [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)

The second step is creating a Django & Celery image. A Docker image is a file, comprised of multiple layers,
 used to execute code in a Docker container. A Docker image is described in `Dockerfile` by default. The most interesting commands is:
 * `FROM python:3.6` creates a layer from the python:3.6 Docker image. You can use other versions of Python (3.5, 3.4, 2.7, ...)
 * `RUN pip3 install -r ${APP_ROOT}/requirements.txt` installs Python dependencies
 * `CMD  ['python3 manage.py collectstatic --noinput', '&&', '/bin/sh','-c','python manage.py runserver']` 
 is used to set a default command for the image. However it will be over-written by a Docker-compose file.
 
## Step 3: Define services in a Docker-Compose file

**Source file:** [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)

Using Docker-Compose is the one of the most easiest way to orchestrate all containers. 
For each part of the project you must create an image, there are images which described in `docker-compose.yml`:

* `nginx` pulls an image from Docker Hub. The volume section overrides a default nginx config with the `devops/nginx.conf`
* `web` is the main Django application's service that uses a Docker image created in the [Docker chapter](#docker)
* `postgres` service. Using all default settings
* `rabbit` uses `rabbitmq:3.7-management` which automatically run RabbitMQ admin web interface
* `celery` service also using an previously created `Dockerfile`

## Step 4: Connect containers using environment variables
**Source file:** [.env](.env)

A module called `envparse` will be used to export environment variables.

First of all, add it to `requirements.txt`. Then create `.env` at the root of the project:

```.dotenv
POSTGRES_DB=postgres
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
POSTGRES_HOST=postgres
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
CELERY_BROKER_URL=amqp://rabbitmq:rabbitmq@rabbit:5672/
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=conf.settings
```

## Step 5: Create GitLab CI/CD pipeline
**Source file:** [.gitlab-ci.yml](.gitlab-ci.yml)

For the education purposes `.gitlab-ci.yml` contains only 2 basic steps: 
* `build` step builds Django application image and push it to a private registry. Substitute a registry URL by your own link.
* `deploy` step logins to a server via ssh and pulls changes from registry

The deploy step uses a `devops/deploy.sh` file. You have to change it: replace **47.47.47.47** to your remote address IP
and replace registry URL:
> docker pull registry.gitlab.com/your_username/your_project_name:latest

## Step 6: Push new files

Push all new files and directories (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `devops/`) to the branch `master`.

## Step 7: Generate SSH keys

Locally run a command `ssh-keygen -t rsa`, it will prompt you to enter passphrase - **leave it blank**. 
The command generates two files with two keys: public and private. 

Copy the public key to your server `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

Also you must to set a CI/CD environment variable called `DEPLOY_KEY` to your private key. 
Go to **GitLab project page - Settings - CI / CD - Environment variables** and create a variable 
![Set variable](https://pp.userapi.com/c854120/v854120736/8f3a/C-NCoEPFCBg.jpg)

## Step 8: Clone a project

Log in the remote server via ssh and clone a project at the root:

`git clone https://gitlab.com/your_username/your_project_name.git`

## Step 9. Make a commit to prove that everything works fine

Or create an issue to make me now that the guide has a mistake
